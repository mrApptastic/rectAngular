<h1>rectAngular</h1>
<p>A small canvas-based game, which can both be played with a mouse and touch devices</p>
<p>The rules are easy enough. You have to keep the ball in play by drawing rects to block the ball before it leaves the canvas. Also you need the watch your amount of line. You use up line equal to the sides of the rects you draw.</p>
<em>Good luck!</em>
